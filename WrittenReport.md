## The App

The project we have chosen to develop for this assignment is something
we have titled "Spotify Party". When public health protocols allow, a user can host
an in-person party with their friends and act as the "DJ" by using our
app. When the host starts a party, they will be able to see their 10
most recent Spotify playlists and choose which one will be the
playlist for their party. The attendees at the party will then be 
able to vote for which songs from that playlist they want to hear
next.
